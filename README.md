The web application is designed as a standalone system accessible via modern web browsers. It includes a login page for user authentication and an in-principle approval page for managing tender details. The application was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, while SQL was used for database management. The development environment involved downloading and connecting a SQL server to Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and utilizing a workbench for database management.
The application features include user login, displaying default messages in the approval form, allowing users to modify specific fields, and saving the modified form as a PDF document. The system is designed to ensure data integrity, security, and ease of use. Below is a detailed description of each component and functionality of the application.
Development Environment- The development environment was meticulously set up to ensure a smooth and efficient workflow. The SQL Server was downloaded and configured to work with Visual Studio Code (VSCode), a widely-used code editor that supports various programming languages and extensions, making it an ideal choice for this project. A workbench was also utilized for managing the SQL database, providing an intuitive graphical interface for handling database operations such as creating tables, inserting data, and running queries.
Frontend- The frontend of the application was built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) was used to structure the web pages, defining the layout and elements of the login and approval form pages. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) was employed to style these elements, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. JavaScript was used to add interactivity to the web pages, enabling dynamic behavior such as form validation, data submission, and PDF generation
Database Management- The SQL database plays a crucial role in managing the application's data. By downloading and configuring SQL Server and connecting it to VSCode, the development team ensured that all database operations could be performed efficiently and effectively.
